## BUG-001 — Duplicate toast notifications

**STATUS:** fixed

**SEVERITY:** medium

**AREA:** notifications

**SYMPTOM:**
Toast notifications for the same message would appear multiple times, especially after page refresh or reconnect.

**REPRO STEPS:**
1. Open Chatlon
2. Receive message from contact
3. Sometimes toast appears 2-3 times for same message

**SUSPECTED CAUSE:**
Gun.on() replays data on reconnect. State-based duplicate check was async and allowed race conditions.

**FILES:**
- src/App.js (showToast, shownToastsRef)

**FIX APPLIED:**
Changed from useState Set to useRef Set for synchronous duplicate checking. Toast key now includes messageId for messages and requestId for friend requests.

**AI WARNING:**
Always use refs (not state) for synchronous checks in Gun callbacks. State updates are async and cause race conditions.

## BUG-002 — Stale closure in Gun message listeners

**STATUS:** fixed

**SEVERITY:** high

**AREA:** gun-sync

**SYMPTOM:**
Message listeners in App.js would use stale values for `conversations` and `activePane`, causing toasts to show even when conversation window was open.

**REPRO STEPS:**
1. Open conversation with contact
2. Keep window open and focused
3. Receive message
4. Toast incorrectly appears despite window being open

**SUSPECTED CAUSE:**
Gun.on() callbacks capture closure at creation time. React state updates don't update the captured values.

**FILES:**
- src/App.js (conversationsRef, activePaneRef)

**FIX APPLIED:**
Added refs that sync with state via useEffect. Gun callbacks read from refs instead of state.

**AI WARNING:**
Never read React state directly inside Gun.on() callbacks. Always use refs and sync them with useEffect.

## BUG-003 — Old messages trigger new message toasts

**STATUS:** fixed

**SEVERITY:** high

**AREA:** gun-sync

**SYMPTOM:**
When opening Chatlon, old messages from Gun replay would trigger toast notifications as if they were new.

**REPRO STEPS:**
1. Have existing chat history
2. Close and reopen Chatlon
3. Old messages trigger toasts

**SUSPECTED CAUSE:**
Gun replays all data on subscription. No filtering between old and new messages.

**FILES:**
- src/App.js (listenerStartTimeRef)
- src/ConversationPane.js (sessionStartTime, lastSeenMessageTime)

**FIX APPLIED:**
Added listenerStartTimeRef set at listener creation time. Messages with timeRef before this are ignored for toasts.

**AI WARNING:**
Any new Gun listener that triggers UI actions must filter by timestamp. Store listener start time and compare against message timeRef.

## BUG-004 — Friend request listener fires for old requests

**STATUS:** fixed

**SEVERITY:** medium

**AREA:** gun-sync

**SYMPTOM:**
Old pending friend requests would trigger toast notifications on every app load.

**REPRO STEPS:**
1. Have pending friend request
2. Refresh page
3. Toast appears again for same old request

**SUSPECTED CAUSE:**
Same as BUG-003 - Gun replays data, no timestamp filtering.

**FILES:**
- src/App.js (setupFriendRequestListener)

**FIX APPLIED:**
Added listenerStartTime check. Requests with timestamp before listener start are ignored.

**AI WARNING:**
Same as BUG-003. All Gun listeners need timestamp-based filtering for notifications.

## BUG-005 — Window position resets on state change

**STATUS:** open

**SEVERITY:** low

**AREA:** window-manager

**SYMPTOM:**
Occasionally window jumps back to previous position after dragging, especially when other state changes occur.

**REPRO STEPS:**
1. Open window
2. Drag to new position
3. Receive message or other state update
4. Window may jump

**SUSPECTED CAUSE:**
Position stored in state, re-render may reset to initialPosition if hasInitialized ref not working correctly.

**FILES:**
- src/Pane.js (position state, hasInitialized ref)

**WORKAROUND:**
Drag window again after it jumps.

**AI WARNING:**
Do not remove hasInitialized ref logic. It prevents position reset on re-render. Fix should ensure ref persists correctly across renders.

## BUG-006 — Presence status not synced across users

**STATUS:** blocked

**SEVERITY:** medium

**AREA:** presence

**SYMPTOM:**
Contact list shows all contacts as "Online" regardless of actual status. Status selector only affects local display.

**REPRO STEPS:**
1. User A sets status to "Away"
2. User B still sees User A as "Online"

**SUSPECTED CAUSE:**
Status is only stored locally, not synced to Gun. No presence heartbeat system implemented.

**FILES:**
- src/ContactsPane.js (myStatus state - local only)

**WORKAROUND:**
None. Feature not implemented.

**BLOCKED BY:**
Requires architecture design for presence system before implementation.

**AI WARNING:**
Implementing true presence requires:
1. Heartbeat system writing to Gun
2. Timeout detection for offline
3. Handle tab close / browser close
Do not implement without architecture review.

**FOLLOW-UP:**
Design presence system with heartbeat and timeout detection.

## BUG-007 — Calculator memory functions not implemented

**STATUS:** open

**SEVERITY:** low

**AREA:** calculator

**SYMPTOM:**
MC, MR, MS, M+ buttons in calculator do nothing.

**REPRO STEPS:**
1. Open calculator
2. Click any memory button
3. Nothing happens

**SUSPECTED CAUSE:**
Buttons exist but no state/handlers implemented.

**FILES:**
- src/CalculatorPane.js

**WORKAROUND:**
Don't use memory functions.

**AI WARNING:**
Low priority. Fix only if specifically requested.

## BUG-008 — Paint undo limited / inconsistent

**STATUS:** open

**SEVERITY:** low

**AREA:** paint

**SYMPTOM:**
Undo in Paint sometimes doesn't work correctly, especially for shape tools during drag preview.

**REPRO STEPS:**
1. Draw rectangle
2. During drag, canvas shows preview
3. Release
4. Undo may restore to wrong state

**SUSPECTED CAUSE:**
History saved at inconsistent points. Shape preview redraws from history during drag.

**FILES:**
- src/PaintPane.js (canvasHistory, historyStep)

**WORKAROUND:**
Use undo immediately after completing action.

**AI WARNING:**
Canvas history system is fragile. Any changes need careful testing of all tools.

## BUG-009 — Media player visualisation stops on tab switch

**STATUS:** open

**SEVERITY:** low

**AREA:** media-player

**SYMPTOM:**
When switching to another browser tab, the visualisation freezes. Audio continues playing.

**REPRO STEPS:**
1. Open Media Player
2. Play track with visualisation
3. Switch to another browser tab
4. Switch back - visualisation frozen or choppy

**SUSPECTED CAUSE:**
requestAnimationFrame pauses when tab is not visible. AudioContext continues.

**FILES:**
- src/MediaPane.js (visualize function, animationRef)

**WORKAROUND:**
Click pause then play to restart visualisation.

**AI WARNING:**
This is browser behavior, not easily fixable. Could detect visibility change and restart animation, but low priority.

## BUG-010 — Emoticon picker closes on scroll

**STATUS:** open

**SEVERITY:** low

**AREA:** chat-ui

**SYMPTOM:**
If message area scrolls while emoticon picker is open, picker may close unexpectedly.

**REPRO STEPS:**
1. Open emoticon picker
2. Receive new message (causes scroll)
3. Picker closes

**SUSPECTED CAUSE:**
Click outside handler may trigger on scroll-related events.

**FILES:**
- src/ConversationPane.js (handleClickOutside, emoticonPickerRef)

**WORKAROUND:**
Reopen picker after scroll.

**AI WARNING:**
Fix should check if click target is actually outside, not just any mousedown event.
